<p>What happens when college testing goes online? How do you build a secure "unbreakable" environment? How do you keep both faculty and student users happy?</p>

<p>Dental Schools across the country are increasingly using the Objectively Structured Clinical Exam as a standardized test to measure clinical skills acquisition. The University of Michigan, a worldwide leader in Dental Education, recognized that the unwieldy paper-based test was causing frustration for both students and faculty graders. My Instructional Design team was charged with improving the testing experience - and moving everything online.</p>

<p>Institutional change can happen at a dizzying pace in small organizations. What happens when a leading nonprofit in Higher Education undergoes a radical rebrand in the face of GDPR and the California Privacy Law?</p>

<p>For starters, a second look at member data and collection practices is in order. My consulting group conducted a seven-stage interview process with stakeholders to clarify existing data practices and sharing habits across the organization. Recommendations were delivered - and some results were surprising.</p>

<p>Digital collections and web content creation are not new ideas to the modern college library. But what does a library with no physical collection look like? It looks like the Taubman Health Sciences Library!</p>

<p>The Taubman Health Sciences Library boasts cutting-edge research tools such as the Anatomage table (as featured on Grey's Anatomy). It also boasts almost 100 separate research guides - portals which assist researchers in navigating the library's extensive digital collections. My team and I used needs assessment and product evaluation to recommend some processes to improve guide layout and overall user experience.</p>


<p>The Right to Internet Access, as postulated by the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society, has interesting implications for the developing world. As a Peace Corps Volunteer, I engaged with some of these implications on a personal level. The Philippine Department of Education has brought the question of technical education to the forefront of their development efforts.</p>

<p>During my service, I helped secure funding for a local e-classroom. Serving as IT administrator and Computer Education teacher to students and fellow teachers was an educational experience in its own right.</p>
